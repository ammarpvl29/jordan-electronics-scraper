# Week 1 Documented Plan: Jordan Electronics Scraping Pipeline

## Project Overview
This document outlines the technical decisions, data collection strategy, and next steps for the Jordan Electronics scraping pipeline targeting SmartBuy Jordan and Leaders Center Jordan websites.

## Database Choice: MongoDB

### Selected Database: MongoDB
**Rationale:**
1. **Company Alignment**: MongoDB is already used by our company's technology stack, ensuring consistency and leveraging existing team expertise.
2. **Schema Flexibility**: Electronics products have varying attributes (different brands, categories, specifications). MongoDB's document-based structure allows us to store products with different fields without rigid schema constraints.
3. **Scalability**: As we expand to more websites and product categories, MongoDB can handle increasing data volumes and diverse product structures efficiently.
4. **JSON-Native**: Web scraping naturally produces JSON-like data structures, making MongoDB a natural fit for storing scraped product information.
5. **Indexing Capabilities**: MongoDB's indexing features support efficient querying by price ranges, categories, brands, and other product attributes.

### Database Structure
- **Database Name**: `jordan_electronics`
- **Collections**: 
  - `products`: Main product data storage
  - `scraping_logs`: Audit trail and monitoring data

## Product Fields Collection Strategy

### Core Product Fields
The following fields are being collected for each product:

| Field Name | Data Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `url` | String | Product page URL (unique identifier) | "https://smartbuy-me.com/product/..." |
| `title` | String | Product name/title | "Samsung WW70T3020BS 7KG Washer" |
| `price` | String | Product price as displayed | "439.000 JOD" |
| `currency` | String | Currency code | "JOD" |
| `source_website` | String | Origin website | "smartbuy" or "leaders" |
| `category` | String | Product category | "washing-machines" |
| `scraped_at` | DateTime | Timestamp of data collection | "2025-09-21T10:30:00Z" |

### Future Enhancement Fields (Planned)
- `brand`: String - Product manufacturer (Samsung, Apple, etc.)
- `model`: String - Specific product model
- `specifications`: Object - Technical specifications
- `availability`: String - Stock status
- `images`: Array - Product image URLs
- `description`: String - Product description
- `rating`: Number - Customer rating
- `reviews_count`: Integer - Number of reviews

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Deliverables
1. **Environment Setup**: Python 3.13, virtual environment, required libraries (requests, beautifulsoup4, pymongo)
2. **Repository Creation**: GitHub repository "jordan-electronics-scraper" by ammarpvl29
3. **Working Links Identified**:
   - SmartBuy: Washing machines category, Samsung product
   - Leaders: English site products, Oppo Reno 14, Reebok smartwatch
4. **Database Implementation**: MongoDB with local instance and MongoDB Compass
5. **Working Prototype**: Both scrapers operational with database integration

### ðŸ”§ Current Technical Architecture
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4 + Requests (chosen over Selenium for simplicity)
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful crawling with delays (10 seconds for Leaders.jo)
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling and logging
- **Data Deduplication**: URL-based uniqueness constraints
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (Week 2)
1. **Project Restructuring**:
   - Implement proper folder structure (src/, config/, tests/, logs/)
   - Create modular architecture with base scraper class
   - Separate database operations into dedicated modules

2. **Data Enhancement**:
   - Extract additional fields (brand, model, specifications)
   - Implement data validation and cleaning
   - Add price parsing for numerical analysis

3. **Monitoring & Reliability**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging system
   - Add health checks and error notifications
   - Create data quality validation rules

## Technical Considerations

### Challenges Identified
1. **Website Structure Variations**: Different HTML structures between sites
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respecting website policies and avoiding blocking
3. **Data Consistency**: Standardizing product information across sites
4. **Dynamic Content**: Some products may require JavaScript rendering

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Robust Selectors**: Multiple fallback strategies for data extraction
2. **Respectful Scraping**: User-Agent headers, delays, robots.txt compliance
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed requests and retries
4. **Data Validation**: Schema validation before database insertion

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals âœ…
- [x] Environment setup complete
- [x] GitHub repository created
- [x] Working links identified from both sites
- [x] MongoDB database chosen and configured
- [x] Functional prototype with data storage
- [x] Documented plan created

### Ongoing Metrics
- **Data Collection Rate**: Products scraped per hour/day
- **Data Quality**: Percentage of complete product records
- **System Reliability**: Uptime and error rates
- **Coverage**: Number of categories and products monitored

## Conclusion

The Week 1 deliverables have been successfully completed with a solid foundation for the Jordan Electronics scraping pipeline. MongoDB was chosen for its alignment with company technology stack and flexibility for handling diverse product data. The current implementation provides a robust base for expansion and enhancement in subsequent weeks.

The next phase will focus on code organization, data enhancement, and building towards a production-ready automated pipeline that can scale to monitor the entire Jordan electronics market effectively.
