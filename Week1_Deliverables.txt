Project #1 Electronics in Jordan, Week#1
Hello Team,
 
Welcome on board with us! Our first project together is to build a pipeline that scrapes product data from electronics websites in Jordan and saves it into a database. The focus of this week is to get started, set up your environment, and move towards a first working prototype.
 
An email was sent over to you to create your emails,  and tomorrow we will complete the on-boarding process.
 
Websites to target:
• SmartBuy Jordan: https://smartbuy-me.com
• Leaders Center Jordan: https://www.leaders.jo
 
Week 1 Deliverables:
 
By the end of this week, you should be able to show:
• Your environment setup is complete (Python, Git, and required libraries installed).
• A repository has been created (GitHub or local).
• Working links have been identified (at least one category and one product from each site).
• A database has been chosen (Excel, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or another option of your choice).
• A first prototype is running, able to fetch and save at least some product data.
• A documented plan including: 
• What database you chose and why.
• Which product fields you will collect (title, price, brand, etc.).
• The next steps you intend to take.
 
Please take initiative in managing your time and approach during this week. The goal is to ensure you have started the project with a clear direction and are able to demonstrate the first results.
